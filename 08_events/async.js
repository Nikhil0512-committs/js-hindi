// In general it's a synchronous language which executes one line of code at a time and it's also a single threaded language
// each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

// Sync code is blocking code which executes line by line , whereas async code is non-blocking code which operates multiply
// Both are good on their own

// JS Engine is made of memory heap and call stack
